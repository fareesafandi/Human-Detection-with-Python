# Human Detection with Python

## How To Set Up

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
This keeps the project isolated so it doesn't break other Python projects on their computer.

```Bash
python -m venv venv
```
### 2. Activate the Environment

- Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

- Mac/Linux: source venv/bin/activate

### 3. Install everything at once

```Bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Run the application
Train 3 Models and store them in Joblib
```bash
python train_models.py
```

Run the application

```bash
python main2.py 
```
